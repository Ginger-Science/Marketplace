    "# Connecting DOPAL's Anti-Aβ Effects with Carbidopa's Absence of Impact: A Mechanistic Hypothesis\n\n## 1. Background\n\nDopamine metabolism plays a complex role in neurodegeneration, with various metabolites exhibiting differential effects on amyloid-β (Aβ) processing and toxicity. DOPAL (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde), a reactive dopamine metabolite, decreases Aβ oligomerization in human neuroblastoma cells, thereby reducing Aβ cytotoxicity. Carbidopa, a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine outside the brain, shows minimal effect on Aβ generation in neuronal cells. L-DOPA itself demonstrates apparently contradictory effects, reducing Aβ plaque numbers in AD mouse models by upregulating amyloid-degrading enzymes (Abstract 1), while enhancing Aβ generation in cell culture through D2R-mediated β-arrestin signaling (Abstract 2).\n\n## 2. Knowledge Gap\n\nThe molecular basis for why certain dopamine-related compounds (like DOPAL) affect Aβ oligomerization while others (like carbidopa) do not impact Aβ generation remains poorly understood. It is unclear whether these differences stem from structural properties, interactions with cellular clearance systems, or involvement in distinct metabolic pathways that ultimately converge on Aβ processing.\n\n## 3. Central Hypothesis\n\nDOPAL reduces Aβ oligomerization by promoting Aβ clearance through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated mitophagy pathway, while carbidopa lacks this effect due to its inability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier efficiently and its distinct chemical structure that prevents interaction with the NLRP3-mitophagy axis that regulates Aβ homeostasis.\n\n## 4. Proposed Mechanism\n\n1. DOPAL, as a reactive aldehyde with specific catechol structure, induces mild oxidative stress in neuronal mitochondria, triggering a hormetic adaptive response that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (as implicated in Abstract 11) at subtoxic levels, unlike its precursor dopamine.\n\n2. This controlled NLRP3 activation enhances mitophagy efficiency and lysosomal function, promoting the clearance of damaged mitochondria and consequently improving overall cellular protein quality control systems responsible for Aβ degradation.\n\n3. Improved mitochondrial quality control reduces oxidative stress that would otherwise promote Aβ oligomerization, while enhanced lysosomal function increases the degradation of Aβ monomers before they can aggregate into toxic oligomers.\n\n4. Carbidopa, in contrast, does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier efficiently and lacks the reactive aldehyde group present in DOPAL, preventing it from interacting with mitochondrial proteins that trigger the adaptive mitophagy response.\n\n5. The NLRP3-mitophagy pathway also interacts with the glymphatic system (described in Abstract 5) through regulation of astrocytic activation state, with DOPAL-mediated mitophagy optimization enhancing glymphatic clearance of Aβ while carbidopa has no such effect.\n\n## 5. Testable Predictions\n\n1. Genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 will abolish DOPAL's beneficial effects on Aβ oligomerization in neuronal cells, while having no impact on carbidopa's actions.\n\n2. Treatment with DOPAL, but not carbidopa, will increase mitophagy flux in neuronal cells as measured by mitochondrial turnover assays, and this increased mitophagy will correlate with reduced intracellular Aβ levels.\n\n3. In AD mouse models, administration of cell-permeable DOPAL analogs will enhance both mitophagy and glymphatic clearance of Aβ (measurable using techniques from Abstract 17), while carbidopa will show no such effects.\n\n## 6. Potential Experimental Approaches\n\n1. Use human iPSC-derived neurons expressing mitophagy sensors (e.g., mt-Keima) to quantify mitochondrial turnover rates following treatment with DOPAL, carbidopa, or vehicle control. Simultaneously measure Aβ oligomerization using FRET-based reporters and assess NLRP3 inflammasome activation using split luciferase constructs, allowing for real-time correlation between mitophagy, inflammasome activity, and Aβ oligomerization in living cells.\n\n2. Employ in vivo two-photon microscopy in transgenic AD mice to visualize glymphatic clearance of fluorescently labeled Aβ after administration of DOPAL, carbidopa, or control compounds, while simultaneously tracking mitochondrial dynamics in neurons and astrocytes using genetically encoded reporters. This approach would allow direct observation of the proposed mechanism's impact on both cellular and system-level Aβ clearance.\n\nThis hypothesis provides a novel mechanistic connection between dopamine metabolism, mitochondrial quality control, and Aβ processing that explains the different effects of DOPAL and carbidopa. By identifying the NLRP3-mitophagy axis as a key regulatory pathway, it offers new therapeutic targets for enhancing Aβ clearance in neurodegenerative diseases while explaining seemingly contradictory findings in the field."

    "Dopamine plays important roles in cognitive function and inflammation and therefore is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drugs that increase or maintain dopamine levels in the brain could be a therapeutic strategy for AD. However, the effects of dopamine and its precursor levodopa (L‑DOPA) on Aβ/tau pathology in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been studied in detail. Here, we investigated whether L‑DOPA treatment alters neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, and tau phosphorylation in 5xFAD mice, a model of AD. We found that L‑DOPA administration significantly reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in 5xFAD mice. In addition, L‑DOPA treatment significantly decreased Aβ plaque number by upregulating NEP and ADAM17 levels in 5xFAD mice. However, L‑DOPA‑treated 5xFAD mice did not exhibit changes in tau hyperphos‑phorylation or tau kinase levels. These data suggest that L‑DOPA alleviates neuroinflammatory responses and Aβ pathology but not tau pathology in this mouse model of AD.",
    "Although levodopa is the first-line medication for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) showing unsurpassable efficiency, its chronic use causes dyskinesia. Accordingly, dopamine agonists are increasingly employed as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa to reduce the risk of motor complications. It is well recognized that patients with PD often exhibit cognitive deficits. However, clinical and animal studies assessing the effects of dopaminergic medications on cognition are controversial. Amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive deficit. Interestingly, the abnormal accumulation of Aβ is also detected in PD patients with cognitive deficits. Evidence indicated that levodopa induced a mild increase of Aβ plaque number and size in the brain of AD mouse. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we present that both levodopa and piribedil enhance the generation of Aβ and the activity of γ-secretase in human neuronal cells and primary neurons isolated from AD mouse. This effect was reduced by either the antagonism or the knockdown of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). We further showed that in the cells expressing β-arrestin 2-biased D2R mutant, piribedil promoted cellular Aβ production to the extent comparable to the wild-type D2R whereas this activity was absent in those with G protein-biased D2R mutant. Moreover, the knockdown of β-arrestin 2 attenuated the increases of Aβ generation and γ-secretase activity mediated by levodopa or piribedil. Thus, our study suggests that targeting D2R-mediated β-arrestin function may have potential risk in the modulation of Aβ pathology.",
    "Our current understanding of the spread and neurodegenerative effects of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) during the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is limited by the presence of confounding non-AD pathologies and the two-dimensional (2-D) nature of conventional histology studies. Here, we combine ex vivo MRI and serial histological imaging from 25 human MTL specimens to present a detailed, 3-D characterization of quantitative NFT burden measures.",
    "The direct access of olfactory afferents to memory-related cortical systems has inspired theories about the role of the olfactory pathways in the development of cortical neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

We find that odor identification deficits are associated with tau accumulation in key areas of the olfactory pathway, with strong predictive power for tau progression.",

    "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the world’s well-known neurodegenerative diseases, which is related to the balance mechanism of production and clearance of two proteins (amyloid-β and tau) regulated by the glymphatic system.

Moreover, the relationship between the glymphatic system and cognitive dysfunction is still worth exploring.",

We further found that feeding mice an iron-reduced diet alleviates iron accumulation in RPMs and improves their function, thus demonstrating that dietary iron reduction can rejuvenate RPMs and enhance iron turnover efficacy.",
