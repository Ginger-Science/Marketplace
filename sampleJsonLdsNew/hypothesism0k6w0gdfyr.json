    "# Connecting DOPAL's Anti-Aβ Effects with Carbidopa's Neutral Impact: The Aldehyde-Mediated Amyloid Clearance Hypothesis\n\n## 1. Background\nDOPAL (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde), a reactive aldehyde metabolite of dopamine, decreases Aβ oligomerization in human neuroblastoma cells and reduces Aβ cytotoxicity through poorly understood mechanisms. Carbidopa, a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents the conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine outside the brain, shows minimal impact on Aβ generation in neuronal cells. Interestingly, L-DOPA administration reduces Aβ plaque burden in 5xFAD mice by upregulating Aβ-degrading enzymes (Abstract 1), yet paradoxically enhances Aβ generation and γ-secretase activity in neuronal cells through D2R-mediated β-arrestin signaling (Abstract 2).\n\n## 2. Knowledge Gap\nThe molecular mechanisms explaining why DOPAL reduces Aβ oligomerization while carbidopa lacks effect on Aβ metabolism remain unclear. Furthermore, while dopamine and L-DOPA show conflicting effects on Aβ pathology across different experimental systems, the specific role of downstream metabolites like DOPAL in mediating these effects is poorly characterized, particularly in relation to Aβ clearance pathways like the glymphatic system (Abstract 5).\n\n## 3. Central Hypothesis\nDOPAL reduces Aβ oligomerization by forming reactive aldehyde-protein adducts with Aβ monomers, triggering their recognition by chaperone-mediated autophagy and subsequent degradation, while carbidopa lacks this effect due to its non-aldehyde structure and limited blood-brain barrier penetration.\n\n## 4. Proposed Mechanism\n1. DOPAL's reactive aldehyde group forms Schiff base adducts with lysine residues in Aβ monomers, creating DOPAL-Aβ conjugates that resist oligomerization due to altered conformational states and surface charges.\n\n2. These DOPAL-Aβ conjugates are recognized by heat shock proteins (particularly HSP70) as misfolded proteins, marking them for degradation through chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a process that bypasses traditional proteasomal degradation pathways that are often impaired in neurodegenerative conditions.\n\n3. The DOPAL-modified Aβ monomers that are not immediately degraded are preferentially transported to the perivascular space via the recently characterized glymphatic system (Abstract 5), where they undergo enhanced clearance due to their altered biophysical properties.\n\n4. Concurrently, DOPAL activates Nrf2 signaling through its electrophilic properties, upregulating expression of NEP and ADAM17 (Aβ-degrading enzymes) similar to the effect seen with L-DOPA in 5xFAD mice (Abstract 1), creating a multi-modal Aβ clearance mechanism.\n\n5. Carbidopa, lacking DOPAL's reactive aldehyde group and having limited brain penetration, cannot form these protein adducts with Aβ or activate the Nrf2 pathway, explaining its negligible effect on Aβ metabolism despite its role in dopamine pathway modulation.\n\n## 5. Testable Predictions\n1. Mass spectrometry analysis of brain tissue from DOPAL-treated mice should reveal the presence of specific DOPAL-Aβ adducts at lysine residues, and these adducts should show decreased propensity to form oligomers in in vitro aggregation assays compared to unmodified Aβ.\n\n2. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of key chaperone-mediated autophagy components (e.g., LAMP2A receptor or HSP70) should attenuate DOPAL's anti-oligomerization effects, while enhancing CMA should potentiate these effects.\n\n3. DOPAL administration should increase glymphatic clearance of fluorescently labeled Aβ in rodent models (detectable using techniques described in Abstract 13), while carbidopa should show no such effect, and this clearance should correlate with cognitive improvements in AD mouse models.\n\n## 6. Potential Experimental Approaches\n1. Develop and utilize a fluorescently-labeled DOPAL analog to visualize the formation of DOPAL-Aβ adducts in live neurons using super-resolution microscopy, tracking their intracellular trafficking and degradation pathways, while simultaneously monitoring markers of autophagy and lysosomal function to confirm the involvement of CMA in their clearance.\n\n2. Employ a combination of pharmacological approaches (administration of DOPAL or DOPAL-generating compounds vs. carbidopa) in 5xFAD mice with real-time monitoring of Aβ clearance using the CSF tracing methodology described in Abstract 13, coupled with cognitive testing and post-mortem analysis of Aβ burden, protein adduct formation, and expression of Nrf2-regulated genes including NEP and ADAM17.\n\nThis hypothesis provides a novel mechanistic framework explaining the divergent effects of DOPAL and carbidopa on Aβ metabolism through DOPAL's unique chemical reactivity and its activation of multiple clearance pathways. It also reconciles the seemingly contradictory findings regarding L-DOPA's effects on Aβ pathology by highlighting the importance of metabolic conversion to reactive intermediates like DOPAL, which may determine whether dopaminergic compounds ultimately promote or inhibit Aβ accumulation."

    "Dopamine plays important roles in cognitive function and inflammation and therefore is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drugs that increase or maintain dopamine levels in the brain could be a therapeutic strategy for AD. However, the effects of dopamine and its precursor levodopa (L‑DOPA) on Aβ/tau pathology in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been studied in detail. Here, we investigated whether L‑DOPA treatment alters neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, and tau phosphorylation in 5xFAD mice, a model of AD. We found that L‑DOPA administration significantly reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in 5xFAD mice. In addition, L‑DOPA treatment significantly decreased Aβ plaque number by upregulating NEP and ADAM17 levels in 5xFAD mice. However, L‑DOPA‑treated 5xFAD mice did not exhibit changes in tau hyperphos‑phorylation or tau kinase levels. These data suggest that L‑DOPA alleviates neuroinflammatory responses and Aβ pathology but not tau pathology in this mouse model of AD.",
    "Although levodopa is the first-line medication for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) showing unsurpassable efficiency, its chronic use causes dyskinesia. Accordingly, dopamine agonists are increasingly employed as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa to reduce the risk of motor complications. It is well recognized that patients with PD often exhibit cognitive deficits. However, clinical and animal studies assessing the effects of dopaminergic medications on cognition are controversial. Amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive deficit. Interestingly, the abnormal accumulation of Aβ is also detected in PD patients with cognitive deficits. Evidence indicated that levodopa induced a mild increase of Aβ plaque number and size in the brain of AD mouse. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we present that both levodopa and piribedil enhance the generation of Aβ and the activity of γ-secretase in human neuronal cells and primary neurons isolated from AD mouse. This effect was reduced by either the antagonism or the knockdown of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). We further showed that in the cells expressing β-arrestin 2-biased D2R mutant, piribedil promoted cellular Aβ production to the extent comparable to the wild-type D2R whereas this activity was absent in those with G protein-biased D2R mutant. Moreover, the knockdown of β-arrestin 2 attenuated the increases of Aβ generation and γ-secretase activity mediated by levodopa or piribedil. Thus, our study suggests that targeting D2R-mediated β-arrestin function may have potential risk in the modulation of Aβ pathology.",
    "Our current understanding of the spread and neurodegenerative effects of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) during the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is limited by the presence of confounding non-AD pathologies and the two-dimensional (2-D) nature of conventional histology studies. Here, we combine ex vivo MRI and serial histological imaging from 25 human MTL specimens to present a detailed, 3-D characterization of quantitative NFT burden measures.",
    "The direct access of olfactory afferents to memory-related cortical systems has inspired theories about the role of the olfactory pathways in the development of cortical neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study used longitudinal PET imaging and diffusion MRI to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading and genetic vulnerabilities of AD-related pathology aggregates in the olfactory system. We find that odor identification deficits are associated with tau accumulation in key areas of the olfactory pathway, with strong predictive power for tau progression.",

HK treatment inhibited age-induced inflammation, fibrosis and senescence markers across several tissues, as well as increased muscle strength and fur thickness compared with age-matched controls.",
    "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the world’s well-known neurodegenerative diseases, which is related to the balance mechanism of production and clearance of two proteins (amyloid-β and tau) regulated by the glymphatic system. Latest studies have found that AD patients exhibit impairments to their glymphatic system. However, the alterations in the AD disease continuum, especially in the early stages, remain unclear. Moreover, the relationship between the glymphatic system and cognitive dysfunction is still worth exploring.",

Iron needs in mammals are met primarily by iron recycling from senescent red blood cells (RBCs), chiefly accomplished by splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs). Here, we found that 10-11-month-old female mice exhibit iron loading in RPMs, largely due to a drop in iron exporter ferroportin, which diminishes their erythrophagocytosis capacity and lysosomal activity. We further found that feeding mice an iron-reduced diet alleviates iron accumulation in RPMs and improves their function, thus demonstrating that dietary iron reduction can rejuvenate RPMs and enhance iron turnover efficacy.",
