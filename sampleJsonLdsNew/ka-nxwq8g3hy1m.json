  "dcterms:abstract": "Bloom syndrome (BSyn, OMIM #210900) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth restriction, sun sensitivity, insulin resistance, mild immune deficiency, and increased risk of early-onset malignancy. Recent studies have identified increased risk of cancers in BLM PV carriers. Using exome sequencing of BSyn patients and BLM carriers, researchers found that both BSyn probands and BLM carriers exhibited an increased frequency of CHIP compared to sex- and age-matched controls. This study sheds new light on the interplay between genetic predispositions and somatic variation and highlights the need for additional studies to further evaluate the mechanisms and potential clinical implications for patients with one or two BLM PV.",
