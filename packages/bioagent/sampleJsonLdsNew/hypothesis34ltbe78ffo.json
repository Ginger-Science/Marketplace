    "# Mechanistic Connection Between DOPAL's Anti-Aβ Oligomerization Effects and Carbidopa's Lack of Impact on Amyloid-β\n\n## 1. Background\nDOPAL (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde) is a reactive aldehyde metabolite of dopamine produced by monoamine oxidase, possessing both aldehyde and catechol functional groups that confer high reactivity with proteins through carbonyl-amine interactions. Carbidopa is a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease treatment that prevents peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain while itself having minimal brain penetration. Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease, with oligomeric Aβ species considered particularly neurotoxic, making factors affecting this process therapeutically relevant.\n\n## 2. Knowledge Gap\nWhile DOPAL reduces Aβ oligomerization and carbidopa lacks effect on Aβ generation, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differential effects remain unclear. Specifically, it is unknown whether DOPAL's effects derive from direct chemical interactions with Aβ or from modulation of cellular pathways affecting Aβ processing, and why carbidopa fails to influence these processes.\n\n## 3. Central Hypothesis\nDOPAL reduces Aβ oligomerization by forming covalent adducts with lysine residues on Aβ monomers through its reactive aldehyde group, creating modified Aβ species that resist oligomerization and are preferentially degraded through autophagy-lysosomal pathways, while carbidopa lacks this effect due to its distinct chemical structure and limited brain penetration.\n\n## 4. Proposed Mechanism\n1. DOPAL, through its reactive aldehyde group, forms Schiff base adducts with lysine-16 and lysine-28 residues in Aβ monomers, regions critical for β-sheet formation during oligomerization, thus stereochemically hindering the protein-protein interactions necessary for oligomer assembly.\n\n2. These DOPAL-modified Aβ monomers undergo conformational changes that expose hydrophobic regions, triggering recognition by cellular chaperone systems including heat shock proteins (HSPs), which direct the modified proteins toward degradation pathways rather than allowing them to participate in oligomerization.\n\n3. DOPAL-Aβ adducts are preferentially targeted for degradation via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway through increased binding affinity for the p62/SQSTM1 adapter protein, enhancing clearance of potentially oligomerization-prone Aβ species from the cellular environment.\n\n4. Simultaneously, DOPAL's catechol group induces mild oxidative stress that activates the Nrf2 pathway, upregulating autophagy and lysosomal function, further enhancing clearance of modified Aβ monomers before they can oligomerize.\n\n5. Carbidopa, unlike DOPAL, lacks both the reactive aldehyde group necessary for Aβ adduct formation and sufficient blood-brain barrier penetration to achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in neurons, explaining its minimal effect on Aβ generation or oligomerization processes.\n\n## 5. Testable Predictions\n1. Mass spectrometry analysis of neuroblastoma cells treated with DOPAL will reveal DOPAL-Aβ adducts specifically at lysine-16 and lysine-28 residues, with the abundance of these adducts correlating inversely with the level of Aβ oligomerization.\n\n2. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy (with bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine) will significantly diminish DOPAL's anti-oligomerization effects, while enhancers of autophagy (rapamycin or trehalose) will potentiate DOPAL's effects, demonstrating the dependence of this mechanism on autophagic clearance.\n\n3. Genetically modified Aβ peptides with lysine-to-arginine substitutions at positions 16 and 28 will show resistance to DOPAL's anti-oligomerization effects, confirming the specific interaction sites required for DOPAL's protective mechanism.\n\n## 6. Potential Experimental Approaches\n1. Develop a cellular assay using fluorescently labeled Aβ monomers in neuroblastoma cells to track the formation and clearance of DOPAL-Aβ adducts in real-time using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, allowing visualization of how DOPAL treatment alters Aβ oligomerization kinetics and subcellular localization of Aβ species.\n\n2. Employ a mouse model with neuron-specific expression of LC3-GFP (an autophagy marker) crossed with an AD model (e.g., 5xFAD as mentioned in Abstract 1) to examine how DOPAL treatment affects autophagy-mediated clearance of Aβ in vivo, using intracerebroventricular delivery of DOPAL to overcome blood-brain barrier limitations and two-photon microscopy to visualize changes in autophagic flux and Aβ deposition.\n\nThis hypothesis provides a novel mechanistic explanation for the observed differential effects of DOPAL and carbidopa on Aβ pathology through direct chemical modification of Aβ and subsequent enhancement of clearance pathways. It aligns with the known chemical properties of both compounds while offering specific, testable predictions that could guide therapeutic approaches targeting protein modification to manage amyloid-related pathologies."

    "Dopamine plays important roles in cognitive function and inflammation and therefore is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drugs that increase or maintain dopamine levels in the brain could be a therapeutic strategy for AD. However, the effects of dopamine and its precursor levodopa (L‑DOPA) on Aβ/tau pathology in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been studied in detail. Here, we investigated whether L‑DOPA treatment alters neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, and tau phosphorylation in 5xFAD mice, a model of AD. We found that L‑DOPA administration significantly reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in 5xFAD mice. In addition, L‑DOPA treatment significantly decreased Aβ plaque number by upregulating NEP and ADAM17 levels in 5xFAD mice. However, L‑DOPA‑treated 5xFAD mice did not exhibit changes in tau hyperphos‑phorylation or tau kinase levels. These data suggest that L‑DOPA alleviates neuroinflammatory responses and Aβ pathology but not tau pathology in this mouse model of AD.",
    "Although levodopa is the first-line medication for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) showing unsurpassable efficiency, its chronic use causes dyskinesia. Accordingly, dopamine agonists are increasingly employed as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa to reduce the risk of motor complications. It is well recognized that patients with PD often exhibit cognitive deficits. However, clinical and animal studies assessing the effects of dopaminergic medications on cognition are controversial. Amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive deficit. Interestingly, the abnormal accumulation of Aβ is also detected in PD patients with cognitive deficits. Evidence indicated that levodopa induced a mild increase of Aβ plaque number and size in the brain of AD mouse. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we present that both levodopa and piribedil enhance the generation of Aβ and the activity of γ-secretase in human neuronal cells and primary neurons isolated from AD mouse. This effect was reduced by either the antagonism or the knockdown of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). We further showed that in the cells expressing β-arrestin 2-biased D2R mutant, piribedil promoted cellular Aβ production to the extent comparable to the wild-type D2R whereas this activity was absent in those with G protein-biased D2R mutant. Moreover, the knockdown of β-arrestin 2 attenuated the increases of Aβ generation and γ-secretase activity mediated by levodopa or piribedil. Thus, our study suggests that targeting D2R-mediated β-arrestin function may have potential risk in the modulation of Aβ pathology.",
    "Our current understanding of the spread and neurodegenerative effects of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) during the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is limited by the presence of confounding non-AD pathologies and the two-dimensional (2-D) nature of conventional histology studies.

We find that odor identification deficits are associated with tau accumulation in key areas of the olfactory pathway, with strong predictive power for tau progression.",

Moreover, the relationship between the glymphatic system and cognitive dysfunction is still worth exploring.",

We further found that feeding mice an iron-reduced diet alleviates iron accumulation in RPMs and improves their function, thus demonstrating that dietary iron reduction can rejuvenate RPMs and enhance iron turnover efficacy.",
