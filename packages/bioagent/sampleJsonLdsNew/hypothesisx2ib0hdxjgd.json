    "# Mechanistic Connection Between DOPAL's Anti-Aβ Oligomerization Effects and Carbidopa's Neutrality on Amyloid-β Generation\n\n## 1. Background\nDopamine metabolites play complex roles in neurodegenerative pathologies. DOPAL (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde), a reactive aldehyde metabolite of dopamine, decreases Aβ oligomerization in human neuroblastoma cells, thereby reducing Aβ cytotoxicity. Carbidopa, a peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease treatment, shows negligible effects on Aβ generation in neuronal cells. L-DOPA administration has paradoxical effects on Aβ pathology, reducing Aβ plaque number by upregulating NEP and ADAM17 levels in 5xFAD mice (Abstract 1), while enhancing Aβ generation and γ-secretase activity in neuronal cells through D2R-mediated β-arrestin signaling (Abstract 2).\n\n## 2. Knowledge Gap\nThe molecular mechanisms explaining why DOPAL reduces Aβ oligomerization while carbidopa has no significant effect on Aβ generation remain poorly understood. Specifically, it's unclear how these structurally distinct compounds interact differently with protein degradation pathways and whether their effects on Aβ metabolism involve convergent or divergent mechanisms related to post-translational modifications of Aβ peptides.\n\n## 3. Central Hypothesis\nDOPAL reduces Aβ oligomerization by forming covalent adducts with Aβ monomers through its reactive aldehyde group, redirecting them toward lysosomal degradation rather than oligomerization, while carbidopa lacks this effect due to its absence of reactive aldehyde functionalities and limited blood-brain barrier penetrance.\n\n## 4. Proposed Mechanism\n1. DOPAL, containing a highly reactive aldehyde group, rapidly forms Schiff base adducts with lysine residues in Aβ monomers, altering their conformational properties and reducing their propensity for β-sheet formation necessary for oligomerization.\n\n2. These DOPAL-Aβ adducts undergo post-translational modifications that serve as recognition signals for the autophagy-lysosomal degradation pathway, enhancing their clearance before they can aggregate into toxic oligomers or fibrils, consistent with the importance of clearance mechanisms in AD pathology (Abstract 5).\n\n3. DOPAL-mediated modifications of Aβ also increase the peptide's affinity for degrading enzymes like NEP and ADAM17, similar to the effects seen with L-DOPA treatment in 5xFAD mice (Abstract 1), further reducing Aβ accumulation.\n\n4. Carbidopa, lacking a reactive aldehyde group and being largely excluded from the brain by the blood-brain barrier, cannot form similar adducts with Aβ monomers, explaining its negligible effect on Aβ generation and oligomerization.\n\n5. The DOPAL-Aβ adduct formation process occurs independently of the D2R-mediated β-arrestin pathway (identified in Abstract 2) that increases γ-secretase activity, explaining why dopaminergic compounds can show divergent effects on Aβ metabolism in different experimental contexts.\n\n## 5. Testable Predictions\n1. Mass spectrometry analysis of brain tissue or cell cultures treated with DOPAL should reveal the presence of specific DOPAL-Aβ adducts that are absent in tissues treated with carbidopa, with these adducts showing modifications primarily at lysine residues of the Aβ peptide.\n\n2. Pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal function (using bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine) should abolish DOPAL's protective effect against Aβ oligomerization, while having minimal impact on carbidopa-treated samples, confirming the dependency of DOPAL's effects on lysosomal degradation pathways.\n\n3. Genetically modified Aβ peptides with lysine-to-arginine substitutions should be resistant to DOPAL's anti-oligomerization effects, as they would lack the primary sites for adduct formation, thereby validating the proposed mechanism of DOPAL-Aβ interaction.\n\n## 6. Potential Experimental Approaches\n1. Develop a cellular model using human iPSC-derived neurons expressing fluorescently tagged Aβ and lysosomal markers to visualize in real-time how DOPAL treatment alters the trafficking and degradation of Aβ compared to carbidopa treatment, employing high-content imaging and pulse-chase experiments to track the fate of Aβ species.\n\n2. Employ advanced structural biology techniques including crosslinking mass spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy to characterize the conformational changes induced in Aβ monomers by DOPAL adduction, comparing these structures with native Aβ and Aβ exposed to carbidopa to identify structural features that prevent oligomerization.\n\nThis hypothesis provides a biochemically plausible explanation for the differential effects of DOPAL and carbidopa on Aβ metabolism based on their distinct chemical properties and reactivity. It identifies a novel mechanism by which dopamine metabolites might influence Alzheimer's pathology and suggests potential therapeutic approaches based on targeting specific post-translational modifications of Aβ peptides."

    "Dopamine plays important roles in cognitive function and inflammation and therefore is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drugs that increase or maintain dopamine levels in the brain could be a therapeutic strategy for AD. However, the effects of dopamine and its precursor levodopa (L‑DOPA) on Aβ/tau pathology in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been studied in detail. Here, we investigated whether L‑DOPA treatment alters neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology, and tau phosphorylation in 5xFAD mice, a model of AD. We found that L‑DOPA administration significantly reduced microgliosis and astrogliosis in 5xFAD mice. In addition, L‑DOPA treatment significantly decreased Aβ plaque number by upregulating NEP and ADAM17 levels in 5xFAD mice. However, L‑DOPA‑treated 5xFAD mice did not exhibit changes in tau hyperphos‑phorylation or tau kinase levels. These data suggest that L‑DOPA alleviates neuroinflammatory responses and Aβ pathology but not tau pathology in this mouse model of AD.",
    "Although levodopa is the first-line medication for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) showing unsurpassable efficiency, its chronic use causes dyskinesia. Accordingly, dopamine agonists are increasingly employed as monotherapy or in combination with levodopa to reduce the risk of motor complications. It is well recognized that patients with PD often exhibit cognitive deficits. However, clinical and animal studies assessing the effects of dopaminergic medications on cognition are controversial. Amyloid-β (Aβ) is one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to progressive memory loss and cognitive deficit. Interestingly, the abnormal accumulation of Aβ is also detected in PD patients with cognitive deficits. Evidence indicated that levodopa induced a mild increase of Aβ plaque number and size in the brain of AD mouse. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here we present that both levodopa and piribedil enhance the generation of Aβ and the activity of γ-secretase in human neuronal cells and primary neurons isolated from AD mouse. This effect was reduced by either the antagonism or the knockdown of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). We further showed that in the cells expressing β-arrestin 2-biased D2R mutant, piribedil promoted cellular Aβ production to the extent comparable to the wild-type D2R whereas this activity was absent in those with G protein-biased D2R mutant. Moreover, the knockdown of β-arrestin 2 attenuated the increases of Aβ generation and γ-secretase activity mediated by levodopa or piribedil. Thus, our study suggests that targeting D2R-mediated β-arrestin function may have potential risk in the modulation of Aβ pathology.",
    "Our current understanding of the spread and neurodegenerative effects of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) during the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is limited by the presence of confounding non-AD pathologies and the two-dimensional (2-D) nature of conventional histology studies. Here, we combine ex vivo MRI and serial histological imaging from 25 human MTL specimens to present a detailed, 3-D characterization of quantitative NFT burden measures.",
    "The direct access of olfactory afferents to memory-related cortical systems has inspired theories about the role of the olfactory pathways in the development of cortical neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study used longitudinal PET imaging and diffusion MRI to investigate the spatiotemporal spreading and genetic vulnerabilities of AD-related pathology aggregates in the olfactory system. We find that odor identification deficits are associated with tau accumulation in key areas of the olfactory pathway, with strong predictive power for tau progression.",

HK treatment inhibited age-induced inflammation, fibrosis and senescence markers across several tissues, as well as increased muscle strength and fur thickness compared with age-matched controls.",
    "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the world’s well-known neurodegenerative diseases, which is related to the balance mechanism of production and clearance of two proteins (amyloid-β and tau) regulated by the glymphatic system.

Moreover, the relationship between the glymphatic system and cognitive dysfunction is still worth exploring.",

    "Aging affects iron homeostasis, as evidenced by tissue iron loading and anemia in the elderly. Iron needs in mammals are met primarily by iron recycling from senescent red blood cells (RBCs), chiefly accomplished by splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs). Here, we found that 10-11-month-old female mice exhibit iron loading in RPMs, largely due to a drop in iron exporter ferroportin, which diminishes their erythrophagocytosis capacity and lysosomal activity. We further found that feeding mice an iron-reduced diet alleviates iron accumulation in RPMs and improves their function, thus demonstrating that dietary iron reduction can rejuvenate RPMs and enhance iron turnover efficacy.",
